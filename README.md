# Learning Machine Learning

I've just created this repository to keep track of my studies in some machine learning 
techniques. I'm following the course ["MACHINE LEARNING A-Zâ„¢](https://www.superdatascience.com/machine-learning/).

Very interesting, I'd recommend it.


## Progress

### Feb 17, 2018

I've started few weeks ago. The course explains how to setup development enviroments
both in R and Python. So far I've prefered to foloow to course in Python but 
the techniques are explained in great detail in both languages.

The hand on part starts explaining how to  prepare a good prepressing script template.

Afterwards I follow the instructions on **Simple Linear Regression**. Very easy to 
follow. And finally I've got my first learning machine. Quite simple, but I'm so
proud! :)
